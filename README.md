Chummer SR4 Update
Modernizing Chummer SR4 to enhance compatibility, usability, and performance. Key updates include:

Improved Display Support: Optimized for modern high-resolution monitors (e.g., 1080p, 2K, 4K).
Framework Upgrade: Migrated to .NET Framework 4.8 for better performance and future-proofing.
Enhanced Usability: Refined UI and functionality for a smoother user experience.
Keith Rudolph, the original creator of Chummer, kindly granted permission for this project, whose contributions have laid the foundation for this continued development.

This update ensures Chummer SR4 remains a valuable tool for players and GMs in the Shadowrun 4th Edition community.
